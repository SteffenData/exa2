// Why would you consider a Scripting Language as JavaScript as your Backend Platform.
// first at all why use scripts like js, first at all for speed compare to java
// js is singlethreaded and that will be a problem with alot of users compare to java where we can start a threadpool
// it is possible to use more (workere in js, but in the long way, im not sure how much better it will be compare to java)
// the data in js can be used from the browser chrome(its the same engine) so if we have more sensitive data, like from a bank
// it will not be a good idea to use it in that kind of a program.
