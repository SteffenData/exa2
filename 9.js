//Explain, using relevant examples, about testing JavaScript code, relevant packages  and how to
//test asynchronous code.

// in this example we use the module chai to test a asynchrono call
// we need to install the module like all the other times we use middleware
//  first we for our own use, say what it will return the it statement, when we add the function (done)
// its now know that it have to wait on the done() before it will return a value
// before that we use the expect for our result to.be here 10
// if thats true it will be great :)

// the strateegy here is to use the done statement, that prevent the function to complete before the result is returning

// Look in the test folder to see a test
